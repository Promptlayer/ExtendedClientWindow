This C++ code provides functionality for extending the client area of a window to cover the entire window, including the non-client area (like the title bar and window frame). It's implemented as a DLL (ExtendClientArea.dll) that can be used in various applications to modify window behaviors. The code involves Windows API and Direct2D manipulation.

Description:
Dynamic Link Library (DLL): The code compiles into a DLL file named ExtendClientArea.dll. This DLL can be loaded into other applications to extend their client area functionality.

Custom Window Procedure (CustomWindowProc): This function is a custom window procedure that intercepts window messages. It modifies the non-client area calculations (WM_NCCALCSIZE) to extend the client area and handles hit-testing (WM_NCHITTEST) to respond to user interactions with the window edges and the maximize button.

Lock Mechanism for Maximize Button: The code includes a locking mechanism (maxButtonLocked) to control interactions with the maximize button. This lock can be toggled on and off using the SetMaxButtonLock function.

Integration with Applications: The DLL provides exported functions (InitializeCustomWindowProc, RestoreOriginalWindowProc, ExtendClientArea, etc.) that can be called from other applications to apply these customizations to specific windows.

Support for Standard Window Commands: Functions like CloseCommand, MaximizeCommand, MinimizeCommand, etc., are provided to perform standard window operations programmatically.

Handling Maximized and Non-Maximized States: The code adjusts the window's client area differently depending on whether the window is maximized or not, ensuring appropriate behavior in both states.

Focus on Accessibility and Usability: By modifying the hit-test area and ensuring that standard window controls are accessible and functional, the code aims to enhance the user experience, especially in custom GUI applications.

Usage Scenario:
This code is particularly useful for applications that require a custom look and feel, where the standard non-client area of the window (like the title bar) is replaced with a client-rendered area. It allows the application to handle window resizing, moving, and standard window control functionalities (like minimize, maximize, close) while maintaining a custom-designed interface.

Integration:
To use this DLL in an application:

Compile the DLL using the provided build command.
Load the DLL in your application.
Call the InitializeCustomWindowProc function with the handle of the window you want to customize.
Use other provided functions to control window behavior as needed.
This approach is commonly used in custom GUI applications where the developer wants to maintain the native window behavior while customizing the appearance and interaction model of the window.
